# WalkBy

#### Simple beginner project written for an Android course at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. 
The purpose was to interact with others via bluetooth without any effort (a "walk-by"), and to gain achievements.

Users earned achievements when:
  * They walked-by enough other unique users (total)
  * They walked-by a unique set of users (ex. one from every continent)
  
The app also had ambitions to show countries interacted with via Google Maps, but unfortunately time ran out.
